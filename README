# btc-price-api

### architecture
there's web API `btc-rates-api` built on top of `http4s`. it accepts http requests on two endpoints: `/rates/{from}/{to}` and `/rates/{for}`.
there's also a Spark app that downloads rates from the internet and process it. In the end the new rates go to kafka, `btc-rates-api` reads them and add to the db.
